                    PulseTech offers a comprehensive set of features that aim to make your health journey smoother
                    and more informed:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Health Dashboard:</strong> The health dashboard is your personal health hub. It
                        aggregates all of your health metrics, such as heart rate, blood pressure, activity levels,
                        and sleep patterns, into an easy-to-read interface. With real-time updates and analytics,
                        you can keep track of your progress and understand what factors are impacting your health.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Appointments:</strong> Booking medical appointments has never been easier. PulseTech
                        allows you to schedule appointments with healthcare providers directly from the app. You can
                        choose from available time slots, receive reminders, and manage cancellations or
                        rescheduling with ease.</li>
                    <li><strong>Symptom Checker:</strong> If you're feeling unwell or unsure about symptoms, the
                        PulseTech symptom checker can help. By answering a series of questions about your symptoms,
                        the app provides potential diagnoses and suggests next steps, whether it's seeing a doctor
                        or taking certain preventive measures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Medication Management:</strong> Staying on top of your medications is crucial for
                        maintaining good health. PulseTech offers a medication tracker that lets you keep track of
                        prescribed medications, dosage instructions, and refill reminders, helping you stay
                        consistent with your treatment plan.</li>
                    <li><strong>Messages:</strong> Communication with healthcare providers is simplified through
                        PulseTech's messaging feature. You can send and receive messages, ask questions, and receive
                        guidance from your medical team, all within the app.</li>
                </ul>
